This Python project utilizes machine learning to analyze and predict accident severity using the U.S. Accidents dataset. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation, with models such as XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and MLP. The analysis incorporates correlation heatmaps, classification metrics, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize predictive accuracy. Interactive visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib provide insights into factors influencing accident severity, aiding in data-driven decision-making.
